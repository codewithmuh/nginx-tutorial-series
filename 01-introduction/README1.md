## What is Nginx?
Nginx (pronounced "Engine X") is a powerful open-source software primarily used as a web server. But its versatility extends much further. Nginx can also function as:  
- **Reverse Proxy**: Distributes requests to backend servers.  
- **Load Balancer**: Efficiently manages traffic across multiple servers.  
- **Content Caching System**: Improves performance by serving cached resources.  
- **Media Streaming Server**: Seamlessly delivers audio and video content.  

### Key Features:
- High performance and low resource usage.  
- Handles massive numbers of simultaneous connections.  
- Originally created by Igor Sysoev in 2004 to solve the "C10k problem" (handling 10,000 simultaneous connections efficiently).

## Why Choose Nginx?
Nginx is widely popular for its:

1. **Scalability**: Its event-driven architecture handles thousands of connections simultaneously.  
2. **Versatility**: Functions as a web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and more.  
3. **Performance**: Outperforms traditional web servers like Apache for static content and high-traffic handling.  
4. **Widespread Adoption**: Trusted by industry giants like Netflix, Airbnb, and WordPress.com.

## Differences Between Nginx and Apache
While both Nginx and Apache are powerful web servers, they differ in several ways:  

| Feature             | Nginx                  | Apache                 |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Architecture**    | Event-driven           | Process-driven         |
| **Static Content**  | Faster serving         | Slower serving         |
| **Configurations**  | Centralized in one file | Distributed with `.htaccess` files |

*Nginx is often preferred for modern, high-performance applications.*
